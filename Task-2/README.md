Image Encryption Tool using Pixel Manipulation

This project demonstrates a simple image encryption and decryption tool developed in Python, leveraging pixel-level manipulation techniques to secure image data. The program implements two main encryption methods: pixel swapping and pixel value shifting. Pixel swapping works by rearranging the pixels of an image based on a secret key, creating a pseudo-random permutation that effectively scrambles the image. Pixel value shifting applies a modular arithmetic operation, adding a fixed integer value to each RGB component of every pixel, thereby altering the imageâ€™s appearance while allowing for easy reversal with the correct key.

By building this tool, I gained practical experience working with the Python Pillow library for image processing, including loading images, accessing and modifying pixel data, and saving processed images. The project also enhanced my understanding of basic cryptographic principles applied to multimedia, highlighting the importance of reversible transformations for secure data encryption and decryption. Additionally, I learned how to design user-friendly command-line interfaces with input validation and error handling to make the tool robust and accessible.

This task deepened my appreciation for the challenges and techniques involved in securing image data and strengthened my programming skills in Python, especially related to handling complex data structures like images. Overall, it provided a solid foundation for exploring more advanced image encryption algorithms and multimedia cybersecurity in the future.
