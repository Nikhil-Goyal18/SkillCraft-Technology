In this task, I developed an advanced password strength checker in Python, which enhanced my understanding of multiple important programming concepts and practical techniques for real-world applications. I learned how to leverage regular expressions for pattern matching to identify the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters within a password. This improved my ability to use regex effectively to solve string validation problems. Additionally, I implemented logic to detect more complex password weaknesses, such as repeated consecutive characters and common sequential patterns, which helped me understand how to analyze strings beyond simple pattern checks.

By assigning weighted scores to different criteria and deducting points based on the presence of password weaknesses, I gained experience in designing scoring algorithms that translate qualitative assessments into quantitative values. This experience strengthened my skills in crafting meaningful feedback for users, as the program not only computes a numerical strength score but also categorizes passwords into levels like "Very Strong," "Moderate," or "Weak" and highlights specific issues that reduce password quality.

The task also taught me to organize code in a clean, object-oriented manner by encapsulating functionality within a class, which improves maintainability and reusability. Furthermore, creating an interactive command-line interface that continuously accepts input until the user decides to exit helped me understand user interaction flows and error handling basics. Lastly, the process of removing comments to produce a production-ready clean code version reinforced best practices in code clarity and presentation. Overall, this task provided a comprehensive experience in building a practical security tool while honing skills in Python programming, string manipulation, regular expressions, and user feedback design.
