During this project, I gained valuable insights into the fundamentals of classical cryptography by developing a program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. I learned how this substitution cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet to create the ciphertext, and conversely, how reversing this shift recovers the original message. Through coding this algorithm in Python, I enhanced my understanding of string manipulation techniques, including working with ASCII values and character encoding to accurately shift characters while preserving case sensitivity.

I also deepened my grasp of programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and input validation by ensuring that the program correctly handles different types of user input, including uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters like numbers and punctuation, which are left unchanged during encryption and decryption. This project helped me to build a user-friendly command-line interface that prompts the user for mode selection (encrypt or decrypt), message input, and shift values, while implementing checks to validate user entries and handle errors gracefully.

Beyond coding skills, this exercise provided an introduction to key cybersecurity principles, illustrating how even simple ciphers are the basis for more complex encryption techniques used to protect data confidentiality. I gained a practical perspective on the limitations of classical ciphers, understanding that while Caesar Cipher is easy to implement, it is vulnerable to attacks and thus not suitable for securing sensitive information in modern applications. This awareness reinforced the importance of continuous learning and exploring advanced cryptographic algorithms.

Overall, the project strengthened my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and appreciation for the role of cryptography in cybersecurity. It laid a strong foundation for further exploration into more sophisticated encryption methods and security concepts, motivating me to pursue deeper knowledge in the field of information security.
